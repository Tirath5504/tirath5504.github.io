# My Weekly Review System: Staying Organized and Productive

Over the past year, I've refined a weekly review system that has transformed how I manage my time and projects. Here's what works for me.

## Why Weekly Reviews Matter

Weekly reviews help you:

- Reflect on accomplishments
- Identify what needs attention
- Plan the week ahead
- Maintain work-life balance

## My Review Process

### Sunday Evening Ritual

I dedicate 30-45 minutes every Sunday evening to review and plan. Here's my exact process:

#### 1. Brain Dump (5 minutes)

I write down everything on my mind: tasks, ideas, concerns. This clears mental clutter.

#### 2. Review Last Week (10 minutes)

- What did I accomplish?
- What challenges did I face?
- What did I learn?

#### 3. Process Inputs (10 minutes)

I go through:

- Email inbox
- Notes and ideas
- Meeting action items
- Project updates

#### 4. Plan Next Week (15 minutes)

I identify:

- Top 3 priorities
- Scheduled commitments
- Potential obstacles
- Personal goals

#### 5. Schedule Deep Work (5 minutes)

I block time for focused work on important projects.

## Tools I Use

### Notion

My central hub for:

- Task management
- Project tracking
- Notes and documentation

### Google Calendar

For time blocking and scheduling.

### Journal

For reflection and gratitude practice.

## Key Principles

### 1. Be Realistic

Don't overcommit. I aim for 3 major tasks per week, not 10.

### 2. Include Personal Goals

Work isn't everything. I always include personal projects and self-care.

### 3. Review Regularly

The system only works if you actually do it consistently.

### 4. Adjust as Needed

What works for me might not work for you. Experiment and iterate.

## Results

Since implementing this system:

- **Reduced stress**: I know what needs attention
- **Better focus**: Clear priorities each week
- **More accomplished**: Consistent progress on important projects
- **Improved balance**: Time for work, learning, and life

## Your Turn

If you're feeling overwhelmed or directionless, try implementing a weekly review. Start small: even 15 minutes can make a difference.

What's your productivity system? I'd love to hear what works for you!
