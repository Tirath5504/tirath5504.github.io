# My Weekly Review System (or how I understood 'Chaos isn't a ladder')

Let me paint you a picture. It's Monday morning. You wake up in a panic because you _know_ you had something important to do but you can't remember what. Was it that project deadline? Or was it the dentist appointment you've been postponing for three months? Or _oh god_ was it your friend's birthday yesterday? Welcome to my life before I discovered weekly reviews.

## How I became a productivity junkie (and why you shouldn't judge me)

I used to be that person who thought productivity systems were for corporate robots who color-label their whatsapp groups (hint) and use words like "synergy" unironically (_shiver_). I was convinced that my brain could handle everything - assignments, deadlines, social commitments, personal projects and that ever-growing list of shows I promised myself I'd watch (_still haven't finished Breaking Bad, don't @ me_). BIG MISTAKE. Never underestimate the sheer volume of information your brain is trying to juggle at any given moment.

The breaking point came during my third year of engineering when I realized I had missed eighteen assignment deadlines in a single week (_how is that even possible?_), forgot to watch _EL Clasico_ (Visca el Bar√ßa!), and showed up to an online orientation that had been cancelled two days ago. I was, officially, a disaster. That weekend, in a state of mild panic, I stumbled upon the concept of "weekly reviews". The idea seemed simple enough - spend some time every week organizing your life. _Surely I can manage that_, I thought naively.

I decided to dedicate my Sunday evenings to this whole "review" thing. Initially, I planned to spend just 15 minutes (_who has time for more than that, right?_) but quickly realized this was like trying to reach Borivali from Dadar in 30 minutes - technically possible but you're running onto an overcrowded train clinging to dear life. So I bit the bullet and committed to 30-45 minutes every Sunday evening.

### Step 1: The Brain Dump 

First things first - I open a fresh page on Notepad (Pages now lol) and just _write everything down_. And I mean EVERYTHING. That random research idea I had at 2 AM? Write it down. The fact that I need to shave? Write it down. That weird concept that my NLP professor mentioned in class that I need to google? Write. It. Down. This process alone is therapeutic. Takes me about 5 minutes and by the end, I have a gloriously chaotic list.

### Step 2: The Reflection Phase

Now comes the part where I channel my inner philosopher (Dionysius who?) and reflect on the past week. What did I actually accomplish? Not what I _planned_ to accomplish (_let's not get too ambitious here_) but what I _actually_ did. This is important because we tend to be our own harshest critics, conveniently forgetting all the small wins while obsessing over that one thing we didn't finish.

I ask myself three questions:

- What went well this week? (_Did I ace that presentation? Did I finally fix that bug that's been haunting me?_)
- What could have gone better? (_Why did I binge-watch an entire season of Game of Thrones instead of working on my project? Oh right, because I'm human._)
- What did I learn? (_Turns out, coffee at 1am is NOT a good idea. Who knew?_)

This takes about 10 minutes but it's genuinely the most valuable part of the entire process. You'd be surprised how much you forget if you don't actively reflect on your week.

### Step 3: Processing the Chaos 

Time to go through all the various "inboxes" in my life. And no, I don't mean just email (_though my 4269 unread emails are silently judging me_). I go through:

- **Email**: I try to achieve inbox zero. I fail spectacularly. I settle for "inbox manageable".
- **Notes App**: Where random thoughts go to die. I go through all those 3 AM ideas and either action them or delete them (_most get deleted_).
- **Meeting Notes**: What did people actually expect me to do after those meetings? Time to figure that out. (especially if you are part of that massive organization with twenty different whatsapp groups)
- **WhatsApp**: Did I promise someone I'd get back to them? Probably. Let me check.

This takes about 10 minutes and prevents me from being "that person" who never follows up on anything (_though I occasionally still am, sorry not sorry_).

### Step 4: Planning the Week Ahead 

Here's where my optimistic self meets my realistic self and they have a frank conversation. My optimistic self wants to: finish three major projects, read two books, have mentoring meets five times, learn German, and also somehow have a social life. My realistic self gently reminds me that I am, in fact, only a Homo Sapien and need to sleep occasionally.

I identify:

- **Top 3 Priorities**: Not 10. Not 5. THREE. If I can't get these done, nothing else matters. This is where I've learned the hard way that saying yes to everything means saying no to the things that actually matter.
- **Scheduled Commitments**: Classes, meetings, appointments - the non-negotiables that I absolutely cannot miss.
- **Potential Obstacles**: Is there a major exam coming up? A project deadline? Or am I just going to be tired because Netflix released a new season of Stranger Things? 
- **Personal Goals**: Because all work and no play makes me a dull person. Maybe this week I'll actually go to that wada pav stall my friends are clamoring about.

### Step 5: Time Blocking 

Final step - I actually schedule time for the important stuff. Not just meetings and classes (those are already there, _unfortunately_) but also time for focused work on those top 3 priorities. This is called "deep work" by the productivity gurus but I just call it "please don't disturb me or I will be invective" time (kudos to GRE - post on this uploaded!).

I block out 2-3 hour chunks where I can actually make progress on important projects without being interrupted every five minutes. Phone goes on Do Not Disturb. Social media gets blocked (_Thanks, [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com)). It's just me and the work. Takes about 5 minutes to schedule but makes a HUGE difference in actually getting things done.

## My Productivity Toolkit (or why I have too many apps)

Let me be real with you - I probably have way too many productivity apps. I am that person who downloads a new todo app every month convinced that _THIS_ will be the one that changes everything (_it never is, but I keep trying_). Nevertheless, here are the ones that have actually stuck:

### Notion

This is where I keep literally everything. Tasks, projects, notes, random thoughts, that recipe I want to try, my book list, my movie watchlist - EVERYTHING. Is it overkill? Probably. Do I care? Not really. Notion has become my second brain and I genuinely panic when I can't access it (_which thankfully is rare_). Also, students can get Notion AI pro for free via the [GitHub Student Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Free stuff is nice. 

### Google Calendar

This is where optimism goes to die. Every time I think "I have so much time this week!", I open my calendar and reality slaps me in the face. But it's essential. I use color-coding (_yes, I've become that person_) - blue for classes, red for deadlines, green for personal time, and purple for "deep work" blocks. It looks like a rainbow threw up on my screen but at least I know where I'm supposed to be and when.

## The Results 

It's been over a year since I started this weekly review habit (_with multiple breaks and restarts_) and I can honestly say it's changed how I operate. Here's what's different:

- **I'm less stressed**: Knowing what needs attention means I'm not constantly worried about what I'm forgetting. The anxiety of "am I missing something important?" has dramatically reduced (_it hasn't disappeared because anxiety doesn't work that way, but it's better_).

- **I'm more focused**: When you have clear priorities, it's easier to say no to distractions. Not easy, but easier. I still get distracted (_hello, [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) rabbit holes_) but I recover faster.

- **I actually finish things**: This is HUGE. I used to start a million projects and finish none. Now I actually complete stuff. Not everything (_some ideas are genuinely terrible and deserve to die_), but the important things get done.

- **I have better work-life balance**: By explicitly scheduling personal time and treating it as non-negotiable as work commitments, I've actually started having a life outside of work and studies (_revolutionary concept, I know_).

## Your Turn 

Look, I'm not going to tell you that weekly reviews will solve all your problems. They won't. You'll still procrastinate. You'll still have chaotic weeks. You'll still forget things occasionally. But they might just help you feel a little more in control, a little more organized, a little less overwhelmed.

If you're interested in trying this, start small. Don't try to implement everything I do - that's a recipe for disaster. Maybe start with just 15 minutes every Sunday. Brain dump and pick three priorities for the week. That's it. See how it feels. Add more if you want. Drop it if it's not working.

And if you already have a productivity system that works for you, that's amazing! I'd genuinely love to hear about it because I'm always looking to improve my own system.
